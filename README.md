# cyberpatriot-database
A website that displays all the past scores that are entered into a MySQL database. Since I do not participate in the competition anymore I am uploading the source for the website that our team used to view all of the previous points we had scored. For obvious reasons, the database is not being uploaded but the structure for the points and username databases can be easily replicated by looking through the code. 

## index.html
The  page for the website

## css/style.css
The main stylesheet for the website

## error/*.html
The error pages that can be configured in your webserver

## js/sorttable.js
A script writen by Stuart Langridge to sort tables on a website, available [here](https://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/)

## pages/connect.php
Connects to the points database

## pages/connect_login.php
Connects to the username database

## pages/database.php
Loads the database into a table

## pages/edit.php
Provides the backend for editing/deleting rows in the database

## pages/insert.php
Provides the backend for inserting rows in the database

## pages/login.php
Checks with the database to see if a user can access the website

## resources/*
Pictures or downloads that are hosted on the server

# Work In Progress
The Windows and Linux html pages are supposed to contain checklists for the competition. Please go ahead and fork the project if you want to contribute!
